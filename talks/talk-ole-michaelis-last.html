      Thats the dream we all share. *Building the one perfect software.* But you know the answer already, you just have to admit it: **There is no perfect software.**
But I've a few tips and tricks to do better: ‘The 12 Factor App’ is a manifesto written by Adam Wiggins (co-founder of heroku) describing the perfect (cloud ready) web app. But it’s way more than that. It should be the standard way of writing apps. Because it contains some tips and tricks how to build your webapp. For example only logging to stdout or that all configuration should be done via environment variables. It’s about building robust and scalable systems. If everyone followed these 12 simple principles, we could have shared tooling across programming languages borders. Image that one pre-build logging and metrics solution. The one and only way of configuring your project. The one way to run it, successfully.
