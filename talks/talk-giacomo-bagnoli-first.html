      These days applications are getting more and more complex. It's becoming quite
difficult to keep track of all the different components an application needs in order to
function (a database, a message queueing system, a web server, a document
store, a search engine, you name it.). How many times we heard 'it worked on my
machine'?. In this talk we are going to explore Docker, what it is, how it works
and how much it can benefit in keeping the development environment consistent.
We are going to talk about Dockerfiles, best practices, tools like fig and vagrant,
and finally show an example of how it applies to a ruby on rails
application.
