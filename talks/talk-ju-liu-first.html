      Everyday we read about DRY, YAGNI, TDD, SOLID, REST, SOA..
We are not only discussing about these concepts, but also we use them as canons to design, build and maintain our applications.

In this talk, I want to explore the possible dangers in treating these concepts as sacred principles: in our everyday life, it pays off to treat these concepts as general guidelines, which can and should be challenged on a daily basis. In doing so, we can improve our understanding of these concepts and become better programmers.

    <p>
      Ju was born in a metropolis in China, then he moved as a kid to the sunny italian countryside. He started messing up with computers late in his life, but hasn't stopped yet.

He got a Computer Science degree, then joined weLaika, a Ruby on Rails consulting company based in Turin. At the beginning of 2014, he decided to go on a new adventure and moved to London, where he joined AlphaSights as a Ruby engineer.

He loves Ruby, likes Javascript and is curious about functional programming. He's a Git user, Vim addict and TDD believer, and most of all he is rarely serious about anything.
