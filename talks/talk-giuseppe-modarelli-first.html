      Ruby has a powerful set of libs and tools that we don't use in our day to day jobs as ruby developers. The main reason for this is because we force logic where it should not be: the template. By refactoring a simple application I'll show you how to unlock the power of Ruby and how to write code that you will love to work with in the future.
